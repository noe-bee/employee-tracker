# Employee-Tracker

## Description

- The purpose of this week's challenge was to create an interactive command-line project which allows data manipulation of the employee database I created. The user is allowed to view and also change the contents of the database by choosing what they would like to do to it. For example, the user can choose "View all departments" to see what departments are available and also "Add a department" to manually input which new department they would like to add. This challenge is by far the most complex I've had to complete, and I was able to learn how to manage the backend of a database by using SQL.


## Installation

- To be able to use this application, nodejs, sql and the inquirer package should be installed to user's machine.

    Nodejs : https://nodejs.org/en/
    
    Inquirer package: https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4

    SQL: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/

## Usage
- The way to use this application is provided through the video link below. User must simply provide answers to the questions asked from the command line to manipulate the data in the database.
